LDAclustering README, Eric Titus, October 2, 2015

To use LDA via Gensim/python to cluster the text data contained in the Data1 csv file, run MainProgram.py, followed by AnalysisProgram.py

Currently, the code in RunLDAgensim groups the data into 35 topics, as determined by the code in OptimizeTopicNumber.py

This code relies on the following external packages:

numpy
scipy
pandas      "pip install pandas" at the command line will install (on linux)
nltk         natural language toolkit-need the most recent version "pip install -U nltk"
matplotlib   "pip install matplotlib" used for plotting
seaborn      "pip install seaborn" Seaborn makes the plots look better
gensim       "pip install gensim" This is the package that does the LDA
